                A child said to his mother, “I want to save the world.”
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                “And how will you do that?” she inquired, amused.
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                He thought for a moment, “Surely I must see the entire world to steward it.”
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                She ran a finger along the tight furrow of his brow. “Look, child. Look up.”
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                He looked. Stars.
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                “See, a whole world. Many worlds. Do you now know how to save them?”
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                He shook his head.
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                “No, you do not. They are wrought so tightly, so dense with life, that you have no
                hope of understanding them.”
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                Innocently, he said, “Then is there a way to fashion so keen a weapon that we may
                drive past their wroughtness to their very cores?”
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                She shook her head. “You are dangerous, my little See-er.” And so his name became
                the See-er, for his exceptionally talented sight, and he was sent to the peak of the
                tallest mountain in all the world so that his violent eyes would be trained to the
                stars and nothing else.
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                During his ascent up the mountain, he came across a mute traveler. They journeyed
                together but throughout the day the traveler neither spoke nor wrote. It was only
                when night fell that the See-er noticed the diamonds and swoops which animated
                themselves around the mute traveler. When the night sky became clear enough to see
                the stars, the See-er gasped, for it was these stars that had begun to encircle the
                mute traveler. “Then you must be the Poet,” he said, breathlessly, “The Poet who has
                learned to unravel the stars.”
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                “Yes,” the mute traveler said. “I am the Poet, who does not speak because of the
                breathtaking beauty of the stars. You must be the See-er, who desires to see the
                whole world.”
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                Upon summiting the mountain, the Poet gifted the See-er the secret to unraveling the
                stars. It was two things: a device and a technique. The device was called the Line
                and the technique was called the Section. The Line, simultaneously a needle point
                and knife edge, could be driven perpendicularly into a surface, and with enough
                control, by turning the Line from perpendicular to parallel, that careful breech
                would blossom and unravel like the delicate petals of a flower, and it was in this
                way that the Poet could spread stardust and cosmic swoops across the heavens, a
                conductor of divine harmonies.
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                For a long time, the See-er was content with this beauty, until one day an instinct
                of great violence, nearly forgotten, rose up within him and he struck the Line
                directly through the heart of some faraway star. Suddenly, he was flooded with
                visions of a whole solar system, their emotions, their knowledge, and then the
                vision of a single core of truth, which he knew to be the answer to the problem of
                that world. He knew then that he had found that instrument, that keen weapon he had
                conceptualized as a child. Through an ungodly and gruesome procedure, he merged his
                sight with the Line and Section. Then he lowered his gaze from the heavens unto the
                world below the mountain.
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                Hearing of these legendary events, pilgrims journeyed to the mountain to witness the
                miracles of the See-er. Perhaps the greatest miracle of them all was the incident of
                the man who was so afraid of death that he achieved immortality. He was an extremely
                wealthy man, and in his unwillingness to die, he had committed a portion of his
                fortunes to the development of a technology which could duplicate the mind and store
                it in a small electronic device. In many ways, it was an elaboration on the Line;
                having unraveled and extracted the mind, this technology forcibly re-wrought those
                strands into an even tighter capsule. Yet, his most dramatic action was done upon
                his body. He had its youth preserved in the most unnatural way. Every cell of that
                body, every chromosome within those cells, each point of that body was monitored by
                a complex system of biotechnic particles which could directly measure and alter his
                telomeres so that not a single cell in his body would die. This was a feat of
                extreme computational intensity, so much so that it required a supercomputer that
                ravaged the environment of the earth in its hunger for life. This immortal man now
                sought a technology to directly siphon the energy from the sun, the theoretical
                Matrioshka Brain, to sustain his artificial life.
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                It is said that the immortal man’s question for the See-er was phrased thusly: I
                have developed two technologies, one to preserve my mind and the other to preserve
                my body. Tell me, is the self in the mind or the body?
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                The See-er trained his eyes upon the immortal man then whispered something in his
                ear. With a sad smile upon his face, the immortal man leapt off the mountain to his
                death.
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                Eventually, the See-er grew impatient with the limitations of his own power. His
                field of vision allowed him only to see and thus solve the problems of one person at
                a time. How could he fit the whole world into his sight? So he ceased his miracles
                to ponder this conundrum. Engineers, scientists, artists, architects, philosophers,
                intellectuals all visited the mountain to lend counsel, but it was the See-er
                himself who eventually found the answer.
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                He restarted the projects of the immortal man. Soon, the technology to duplicate
                human minds became widespread, and the Brain began construction around the Sun. This
                Brain would encase and capture the radiant energy of the sun with a series of nested
                shell, powering the Brain as it hosted the digital copies of all of humanity.
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                In the end, it was only the See-er and the Poet who remained on the mountain top, on
                earth. Before the See-er turned his eyes toward the Brain, the first time he would
                look at the heavens since that time long ago, the Poet broke his silence and asked,
                “What did you tell the immortal man? Where resides the self?”
            </div>
            <div class="body-section--paragraph">
                He smiled patiently and responded, “My old friend, do you know how I found the
                truthful answer to the mind-body problem? It is not as you think. When I trained the
                Line upon the immortal man, I learned something about him, which was that in his
                exceptional age and wisdom, he had accumulated a certain attitude toward the world
                that was reflective of the rest of humanity, one that he could not admit to himself.
                And this attitude was that the words “body” and “mind” were depraved in their false
                disparity, and that his self, that dynamic interpenetration of the physical and the
                psychal, was something that could not be attenuated any farther. For in his
                ambivalence, he had treated his mind and his body in separation; his body brought
                into stasis using the lifeforce of the earth and his mind copied and preserved
                within the realm of the digital. So I told him that there was no soul to be found
                within the mind-body problem, and then he was ready to die. With the Line, I could
                never ascertain the truth as you might understand it, but it was a truth which was
                provisional and always perfectly adequate.”
