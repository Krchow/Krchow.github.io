                                    The mission of the Capsule Corporation has always been the salvation of mankind. In the face of impending environmental, political, economic, financial, and moral disaster, the Corporation seeks to use its signature technology, the CAPSULE, to create digital “backups” of all viable human minds, thereby ushering in the digital future of humanity.
                                </p>

                                    The technology of the Capsule is premised on the simple assertion that user data, varied in its forms, can constitute an effective reflection of the user. The essential innovation of the Capsule is the synthesis of a user’s Internet and biometric data, using sophisticated machine learning processes, to create a proxy of its user’s mind.

                                    The Inventor retains influence on the Capsule Corporation through his control of the intellectual property rights of one of the functions of the Capsule: the diagnostic mode, colloquially known as the SIMULATION. The simulation allows the Inventor to “look inside” and therefore evaluate the fidelity of the proxy mind within the Capsule. Interpretation of the simulation is often contestable; information is conveyed through parabalistic narrative, though aspects of real technical information have been discovered.

                                <p class="body-section--paragraph">
                                    As much as the Corporation appreciates the Inventor as the genius behind the Capsule, his participation in the goals of the Corporation have been passive or even antagonistic. The Corporation has devised for him a clever assignment: to locate the “soul” within the simulation. The task, described as a “goose chase,” is meant to prioritize extracting unmediated information from the simulation. The Department of Simulation (better known as the Department of Soul-Searching) has already yielded crucial technical information from this assignment, such as the science of the Brain.

                                    The Brain elaborates upon the project of the Capsule. The Brain is currently a theoretical project gleaned from the simulation. The Brain is a supercomputer which would store mind proxies from all Capsules. The Brain is composed of a series of nested spheres which surround the sun; the innermost sphere would draw energy directly from the sun, the waste heat from that sphere would be absorbed by the next sphere, its waste heat would be absorbed by the next, and so on.
