                            <span class='underlined'>Messenger</span>: Yessir, I’ve read it. I’ve read it a hundred times. Hardest thing I’ve ever read . . . . Anyway, I’m just calling to give you the good news: we’re going ahead with it! It’s all confirmed and ready to go, the project—what’s it called—the Brain.<br>
                            <br>
                            [Silence]<br>

                            <span class='underlined'>Messenger</span>: Hello?<br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Inventor</span>: <span class='blacked-out'>The Brain?</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Messenger</span>: Uh, lemme double check. Yeah they’re calling it the Brain, sir. It’s based on the thing from the simulation. A new home for all our digital copies when our old home eats it. Like Noah’s Ark but for everyone.<br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Inventor</span>: <span class='blacked-out'>God, they’re out of their minds . . . . That’s what they’ve decided? They’re going to upload everyone into a supercomputer? </span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Messenger</span>: Mhm, yep, you know all about it, They plucked the concept straight from the simulation, We’ve figured out the science and they’re saying it makes perfect sense.<br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Inventor</span>: <span class='blacked-out'>And why the hell would they go with it after seeing the simulation?</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Messenger</span>: Ok, hold your horses. Lemme check my notes. So the simulation doesn’t get into the specifics of the digital mind copies, but it sounds exactly like our Capsule technology, so we figured that it probably takes bio . . . biometric—sorry, new word for me—biometric data and online data from the users, just like the Capsule does, and makes a proxy of the user’s mind with that data. Your own personal copy of yourself. Well, you know all that ‘cause you invented the Capsule, duh! And they’re saying that the simulation’s pretty accurate to real life in that respect so the rest of the simulation seems like the logical plan to follow. Upload all those mind copies to the Brain. Right? ‘Cause the whole purpose of your simulations with the Capsule was to see if it was smart enough, right, and they’re saying the plan with the Brain is plenty smart.<br>
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Messenger</span>: Hello? You there, sir?<br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Inventor</span>: <span class='blacked-out'>Morons.</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Messenger</span>: Look, sorry sir. Don’t get on me about this; I’m just doing my job here, sir. Look, I’m just gonna read my notes here. As much as we appreciate that you’re the genius behind the Capsule, your only job was to download your mind into the Capsule and let its algorithms unravel it until it found a soul. And by your own account it seems like the Capsule is highly intelligent and humane to the point that it is providing us a perfectly sound strategy for the salvation of mankind—<br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Inventor</span>: <span class='blacked-out'>Hah. My only job was to find the soul. If they had any ounce of self awareness. Tell me, child, do you know what a soul is?</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Messenger</span>: Uh, no sir. I’m not a child, by the way, but I guess I never really thought about it. What would you say a soul is, sir?<br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Inventor</span>: <span class='blacked-out'>Recall . . . do you remember what the See-er tells the Poet? At the very end?</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Messenger</span>: Ermm, kinda. I’ve heard about . . . I looked it up ‘cause it seemed important, I looked up the body-mind problem I mean, and I know the simulation says that body and mind don’t work as separate ideas anymore, because, well the two things aren’t actually so separate, because, well . . . I’m not super sure?<br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Inventor</span>: <span class='blacked-out'>Good. You know more than you think, child. The mind-body problem became irrelevant as soon as modern science realized that the difference wasn’t quite so clean, and so the soul, a cultural concept of course, really had nowhere to go.</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Messenger</span>: I . . . I don’t think I really get it. That last thing you said.<br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Inventor</span>: <span class='blacked-out'>Focus, child. The point of it all is that if there’s no soul, what in god’s name are we doing, keeping just the mind? What are we really keeping? Scraps of data? You see why that is a problem, child?</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Messenger</span>: Yeah . . . I think so. But like I said before—<br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Inventor</span>: <span class='blacked-out'>The story isn’t a plan to follow. It’s a complex simulation of my mind. It reaffirms that we’ve really lost all sense of the soul, child.</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Messenger</span>: Look, sir, I’m not a child—<br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Inventor</span>: <span class='blacked-out'>There’s no point trying to copy us over.</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Messenger</span>: Look, sir, I know I don’t know nearly as much as you, but that sounds like bull. Some old tired person’s bull.<br>
                            <br>
                            [Silence]<br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Messenger</span>: Sorry.<br>
                            <br>
                            [Silence]<br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Messenger</span>: Sir, can you be honest with me? What’s it like to know that it’s . . . that it’s your mind in that Capsule?<br>
                            <br>
                            <span class='underlined'>Inventor</span>: <span class='blacked-out'>It’s a good question. Agony, child. Pure agony. To know that I went through all the toil to create the Capsule just for it to tell me—just for me to tell myself—that the whole project was for naught. But it is also beautiful, to unravel your own mind and see it rendered with such lyricism. Remember, child, that in the end, the See-er and the Poet used the same device. The ambitions of the See-er caused him to move humanity to such a distance that it, in its entirety, could fit in his sight. But how can you see at such a distance? How can you see the way hands touch, how mouths move, how people live? This is our trouble today, child. We have compiled all of humanity into a database, and yes, now we can hold the entirety of the world in view, but what good of a world is that?</span><br>
