                                This thesis is a script and film about the transformation of 
                                the biological subject into the digital subject. It is about 
                                problematizing that transformation, deconstructing that black 
                                box, and laying all of its components—technopositivism, quiet 
                                compliance, digitization of the soul—on the table.<br><br>

                                This thesis is told through two stories, one nested within the 
                                other. The first, the outermost layer, is the story of the 
                                inventor of a technology called the Capsule, a personal electronic 
                                device which synthesizes biometric and online data using 
                                sophisticated machine learning processes to create a proxy of 
                                the mind. He is tasked by the Capsule Corporation to analyze the 
                                mind-proxy through the Capsule’s diagnostic function, colloquially 
                                known as the Simulation, a parabalistic representation of the 
                                contents of the Capsule. He is to look for the existence of the soul.<br><br>

                                The second story, the inner layer, is Simulation: A Vision of 
                                the World. A character known as the See-er, named for his 
                                exceptionally talented powers of sight, is given a technology which 
                                allows him to extract the core from anything. Eventually, humanity 
                                is brought into transhuman existence in a supercomputer that draws 
                                energy from the sun, positioned at such a distance as to be within 
                                the See-er’s scope of vision, so that the core of humanity itself 
                                can be extracted.<br>
